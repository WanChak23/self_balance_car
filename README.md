# self_balance_car

This is a dual motor self balancing car by Makeblock MegaPi (ATmega2560-based micro control board). 
The PID controler calculatez the speed of the encoder motor with the data from the gyroscope sensor.
This is programmed in C++.

(Further PID tunning is needed to make it blances stably)
